* NanoPoly Beta version
** Main tasks [4/4]
- [X] Rewrite the unbonded crosslinking function so that it may be applied anytime.
      This includes the beginning of the simulation.	
- [X] Allow the bonded crosslinking function to be run at any time during structure generation.
- [X] Allow the random walks to be run after crosslinking.
- [X] Develop the bonding system to work between multiple atom types.
      Given three types, A, B and C, the user should ideally be able to assign multiple types to all
      pairs of beads.
                                       |   |   A |   B |   C |
                                       | A | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 |
                                       | B |     | 0.1 | 0.2 |
                                       | C |     |     | 0.1 |

** Subtasks [2/2]
- [X] Find a way of converting the types dictionary to numerical format.
- [X] *Automatically* outline what the numbers correspond to in the LAMMPS file.


* Changes and removed code
  - Got rid of the comms_modify command in the "settings" function
