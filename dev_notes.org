** Potential Structures
** Bugs
*** DONE BUG: undetected beads that are too close
- Defining features of the bug:
  a) The errors themselves have no commonalities aside from that they are more frequent in dense systems.
  b) *THE BUG DOES NOT APPEAR WHEN A SINGLE WALK IS GENERATED WITHIN THE BOX.*
     *IT EXCLUSIVELY OCCURS WITH MULTIPLE WALKS*!!!
- Does the bug scale with density? 
  *YES*
*** TODO BUG: issue with the bead types detection
   The bug occurs because the random walk algorithm is fixed at 1,
   so setting a bead type as "2" will cause it to reaise a key error.
